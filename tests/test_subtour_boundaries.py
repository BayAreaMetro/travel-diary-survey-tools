"""A subtour's return leg belongs to the subtour, even when the tour ends there.

``expand_anchor_periods`` marks the first and last trip *touching* the anchor,
and subtour detection skips both: they are normally the commute in and the
commute out, which belong to the parent tour. That reasoning holds only while
something after the subtour leaves the anchor again.

When the tour ends at the anchor -- ``Home -> Work -> Lunch -> Work``, a diary
day that stops at the workplace -- the last trip touching the anchor *is* the
subtour's return leg. Skipping it scored the outbound leg as a subtour and the
trip back to work as no subtour at all, leaving a one-legged subtour that never
closed.

# What these tests assert

Each case states the itinerary and the subtour number expected per trip, read
off the definition rather than off the implementation: a subtour is the run of
trips that leaves an anchor and comes back to that same anchor, and the legs
that bound the anchor period are the commute and belong to the parent tour.

``assert_subtour_invariants`` then checks the properties that must hold for
*any* itinerary, so a future change cannot satisfy the worked examples while
breaking the rule they illustrate.
