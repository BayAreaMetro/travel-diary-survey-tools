"""Select the records a formatter may see, by reading a verdict rather than making one.

A formatter does not decide which records exist. `cascade_completeness` decides
that once, for every consumer, and stamps it as a usability profile; this reads
the profile the config names and keeps what it admits.

That is the whole of it, and the reason is arithmetic rather than tidiness. The
weighting sums over the records a profile admits, so anything the formatter
removed *afterwards* would leave a weight standing for records that are not in
the output. Filtering on the same verdict the weighting used, and checking that
the records kept carry every weight that came in, makes the two agree.

Which records survive is decided by
[`keep_records`][processing.completeness.kept_records.keep_records], which lives
beside the cascade so the weighting can read the same answer.

Weights and joint ids are read for the profile this consumer names, so its
universe, its weights and its joint tours are the same universe. Where a record
still carries no weight it is reported, not removed: a zero means its scope
kept no usable record to share the parent's claim among, a null means no
weight was ever estimated for it, and both are recoverable in a way that
deleting the record is not.
