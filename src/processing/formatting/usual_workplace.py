"""A model's usual workplace: the reported one, else the one found from trips.

Activity-based models send every work tour to the person's usual workplace, and
a worker without one makes no work tours. The survey only asks for a workplace
when the job has one fixed location, so a worker whose location varies, or who
works remotely, has none -- even when their trips show them working at the same
place day after day.

Here that observed workplace stands in. It is an inference, made only for the
model formatters and only where the survey gave nothing: canonical persons keep
the reported workplace alone, a reported workplace is never replaced, and only
someone employed gets one.
