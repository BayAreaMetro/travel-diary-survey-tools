"""Which records a usability profile admits, read off every table at once.

Nothing here removes a record from the canonical data. ``keep_records``
returns *filtered copies* of the tables it is given -- the rows whose verdict
column is true -- and leaves the inputs as they were. Only a formatter ever
writes fewer records than the survey holds, and it writes exactly these.

Filtering each table on its own verdict is enough because the cascade already
made the verdicts agree: it carries the household's verdict down to every
record in it, voids the joint ids of any grouping it rejects, and dissolves
any grouping left with one record. What this module adds is the proof. After
filtering it follows every reference the schema declares and raises on the
first one that no longer resolves, so a cascade that stops agreeing with
itself fails here, loudly, rather than being quietly patched.

The formatters gate on this, and the weighting runs it as a check: weight on
a record the filter excludes is weight the output would lose.
