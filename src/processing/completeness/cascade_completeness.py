    """Cascade ``survey_complete`` through the hierarchy and stamp one column per profile.

    Walks both kinds of flag across every table so they are internally consistent
    with whatever was set upstream (the vendor's day-level completeness, any
    manual adjustments in the project cleaner, and the structural verdicts from
    tour extraction):

    * ``survey_complete`` -- survey reporting completeness, cascaded hh <-> person <->
      day <-> trip/tour, and over household-days. Never narrowed by model criteria, and never
      configurable: if it is wrong the fix belongs upstream in the cleaner.
    * one column per usability profile -- the subset of ``survey_complete`` that
      profile admits.

    A profile states its standard on five axes: which home has to close a tour,
    what the household-date has to show, which zone system must hold every
    location, what a joint tour has to be, and which days of the week it takes.
    Several can be stamped in one run so different consumers can hold different
    standards -- a joint-tour model needs whole households and fully joint
    tours, a trip-level estimation does not:

    ```yaml
    usability_profiles:
      ctramp:
        tour_closes_at: primary_home
        household_day_needs: all_members
        zone_coverage: taz
        joint_tours: fully_joint
        travel_days: [tuesday, wednesday, thursday]
      analysis:
        tour_closes_at: anywhere
        household_day_needs: nothing
        zone_coverage: none
        joint_tours: partial
        travel_days: [monday, tuesday, wednesday, thursday, friday, saturday, sunday]
    ```

    Nothing is implicit: every column stamped is named in config and every
    profile answers every axis. Consumers then choose which to honour by name
    (``weight_profiles`` in the weighting, ``usability_profile`` in each
    formatter), and none of
    them re-derive completeness or tour validity -- the formatters read the
    column and raise if it is absent. ``survey_complete`` is always available as the
    floor without being declared.

    See [`stamp_usable`][processing.completeness.stamp_usable] for the per-level
    rules and [`parse_usability_profiles`]
    [processing.completeness.parse_usability_profiles] for the vocabulary.

    Args:
        tables: The canonical tables in ``requires``; ``household_days`` is built
            by the project cleaner.
        usability_profiles: Profile name -> ``{tour_closes_at, household_day_needs,
            zone_coverage, joint_tours, travel_days}``.
            Required, and every profile answers every axis: there is no default
            at either level, so a verdict never appears unasked and a column's
            meaning is never implicit.

    Returns:
        The tables, each with ``survey_complete`` reconciled and one column per
        profile added.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If ``usability_profiles`` is missing or malformed.
