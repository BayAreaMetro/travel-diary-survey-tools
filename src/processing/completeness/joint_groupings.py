``joint_tour_id`` and ``joint_trip_id`` record the groups the survey detected,
once, for every profile. Whether a record is *on* its group is a profile's
call, so each profile gets its own copy of the id -- ``joint_tour_id_<profile>``
on tours and both trip tables, ``joint_trip_id_<profile>`` on linked trips --
holding the same value where the record is on it and null where it is not.
Nothing here edits the bare id.

[`usable`][processing.completeness.usable], since it reads
every table's verdict. The functions below are in the order they run.
