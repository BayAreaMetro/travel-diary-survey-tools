"""PUMS microdata I/O.

Reads the Census Bureau's official ACS PUMS 1-year files, kept in the census
folder as ``pums_<year>/csv_h<st>.zip`` and ``pums_<year>/csv_p<st>.zip``,
translates their coding to the Census API's, checks them, and casts them to
numeric dtypes. A file missing from the folder is downloaded there first, so a
fresh clone runs without any manual step; after that every run reads it as it is.

Records come back as the Census published them: which ones count is decided by
``pums_cleaning``, recoding lives in ``control_data`` and aggregation in ``incidence``.

    Unlike the household-size check there is no cross-table fact to test these
    against, and a shuffled weight is still a plausible weight -- which is how
    65% of them stayed wrong across months of runs without anything noticing.
    Correlation with the full weight is the invariant that does hold. Two bounds
    test it:

    * ``_MIN_REPLICATE_CORRELATION``: a replicate is a perturbation of the full
      weight, so the two track each other. On clean 2023 California data every
      replicate correlates 0.77 with WGTP; misattributed ones sat at 0.20. The
      bound is loose because the sound value is a property of the sample --
      another state or vintage need not give 0.77 -- so it only separates
      "tracks its weight" from "does not".
    * ``_MAX_REPLICATE_CORRELATION_SPREAD``: replicates of one weight are built
      alike, so they correlate with it to the same degree, whatever that is.
      Sound data agrees to within 0.009 across all 80; a partly misattributed
      file split into two groups 0.605 apart. Being relative, this needs no
      assumption about the sound value, which makes it the stronger check. It
      cannot stand alone: if *every* replicate were misattributed they would
      agree on being wrong, which the first bound catches.
