"""Orchestration behind the ``compute_weights`` step.

Runs the weighting via
[`WeightingPipeline`][processing.weighting.core.pipeline.WeightingPipeline]:

1.  **Setup** — parse YAML config → specs, target names, merges, importance.
    Cross-tab controls are registered with pre-merged dimensions so the
    enum reflects the effective cell count.
2.  **Data fetching** — read the official PUMS files (downloading any that are
    missing); receive survey tables.
3.  **Zone assignment** — crosswalk assigns ``target_zone_id`` and
    ``zone_group_id`` to survey households (point-in-polygon). Zone groups (if
    configured) are applied inside the crosswalk so ``zone_group_id`` is ready
    for balancing.
4.  **Conformance** — recode both PUMS and survey through identical control
    expressions → same control-column schema.
5.  **Incidence pivot** — unified pivoter produces identical
    ``{ctrl}__{member}`` column layout for both datasets; the crosswalk then
    allocates the PUMS weights to target zones.
6.  **1-D merges** — global merges collapse incidence columns symmetrically
    on both tables (originals dropped).  Zone-specific merges add merged
    columns (originals kept) and modify control totals for the specified
    zones after aggregation.
7.  **Control totals** — aggregate PUMS incidence into target totals per zone.
8.  **Balancer** — base weights → max-entropy balancing → weight propagation.

# Design decisions

* **Balancer** — PopulationSim's numba balancer (``np_balancer_numba``),
  vendored in ``balancing/_np_balancer.py``: a pure ``@njit`` function taking
  numpy arrays, so PopulationSim itself is not a dependency.
* **Geography columns** — three distinct levels: ``PUMA`` (raw Census
  PUMA), ``target_zone_id`` (crosswalk target zones from the user's polygon
  file), and ``zone_group_id`` (zone group, equal to ``target_zone_id``
  unless zone groups are configured).  Downstream balancing always uses
  ``zone_group_id``; diagnostics/maps use ``target_zone_id`` for spatial detail.
* **Symmetric incidence** — both the survey sample and the PUMS universe are
  first recoded and pivoted into incidence tables with identical column
  layouts.  Geography, merges, and crosstabs are applied *after* incidence
  construction, keeping the recode/pivot logic independent of geography.

!!! Algorithm

    Find weight vector **w** closest to seed weights **w₀** (KL-divergence)
    subject to marginal constraints:

    min Σᵢ wᵢ ln(wᵢ / w₀ᵢ)   s.t.  A w = t,  wᵢ ≥ 0

    where **A** is the incidence matrix and **t** is the target totals vector.
    Runs independently per zone group (zone groups are parallelisable).

class WeightingPipeline:
    """Stateful weighting pipeline.

    Separates *configuration* (frozen at ``__init__``) from *intermediate
    state* (built up phase-by-phase).  Phase methods are designed to be
    called in sequence from the
    [`@step() compute_weights`][processing.weighting.compute_weights.compute_weights]
    entry-point; each stores results as instance attributes.

    # Usage

    ```python
    pipeline = WeightingPipeline(
        controls=..., config=..., data=..., balancing=..., importance=...
    )

    pipeline.setup()
    pipeline.fetch_pums()

    pipeline.place_households()
    pipeline.recode_and_pivot()
    pipeline.allocate_pums()
    pipeline.apply_merges()

    pipeline.aggregate_totals()
    pipeline.resolve_importance()

    pipeline.fit_all(diagnostics=...)  # one fit per configured profile
    ```

    # One fit per profile

    Everything above ``fit_all`` describes the survey and the controls, so it is
    shared. Everything from the seed onward belongs to a *profile*: which
    households are admitted, what they were balanced to, and the weight columns
    written. Each fit's products live on its own
    [`ProfileFit`][processing.weighting.core.specs.ProfileFit], and its columns
    carry the profile name as a suffix.

    A profile is fitted, never derived from another profile's fit. Reusing one
    profile's household weights for a different universe produces numbers
    indistinguishable from balanced ones that match no control total; the honest
    way to impose weights from outside is
    [`add_existing_weights`][processing.weighting.existing_weights.add_existing_weights],
    which says so in its name.

    Each fit keeps its own seed, weights and statuses on ``fits``. Sharing
    instance attributes for those would leave the last profile's numbers
    standing as the ones the diagnostics and the checks describe.
