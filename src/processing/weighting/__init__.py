"""Survey weighting module.

This module provides two pipeline options for attaching expansion weights to
survey tables:

1. **``add_existing_weights``** -- load pre-computed weights from CSV files and
   join them to tables, optionally deriving missing weights by propagating
   values through the survey hierarchy.
2. **``compute_weights``** -- compute weights from scratch using PUMS / ACS
   microdata as population controls via maximum-entropy balancing.

The ``compute_weights`` step orchestrates the full pipeline — see
``compute_weights.py`` for the detailed step-by-step description.

# Weight hierarchy

Every weight is written once per profile, suffixed with its name
(``hh_weight_<profile>``, ``person_weight_<profile>``, ...):

    hh_weight
      └─ person_weight        (household's weight, shared among its usable persons)
          └─ person_day_weight        (split: a person's usable days sum to their weight)
              └─ unlinked_trip_weight  (day's weight, shared within the day)
                  ├─ linked_trip_weight   (mean agg via linked_trip_id)
                  │   └─ joint_trip_weight (SUM agg via joint_trip_id)
                  └─ tour_weight          (mean agg via tour_id)
                      └─ joint_tour_weight (SUM agg via joint_tour_id)
