"""Attach pre-computed weights to survey data tables.

This module provides the ``add_existing_weights`` pipeline step, which loads
weight CSV files and joins them to the corresponding canonical tables.
Optionally, it can derive missing weights by propagating values through the
survey hierarchy.

# Core algorithm

## Phase 1 -- Load and Join Weights

1. For each provided weight config:

    1. Validate the config key against allowed table types.
    2. Load the weight CSV from ``weight_path``.
    3. Validate required ID and weight columns exist.
    4. Handle ID column name mismatches (rename if needed).
    5. Left-join weights to the table on the ID column.

## Phase 2 -- Move weight off dropped records, per profile

Households, then persons within their household, then each person's days, then
each day's trips. See the Existing Weights docs page for the rules and worked
examples.

## Phase 3 -- Derive Missing Weights (when ``derive_missing_weights=True``)

1. *Down the hierarchy* for household → person → day → unlinked_trip:
   validate parent has weights, then share the parent's weight among its usable
   records (a person's usable days split their weight, rather than each
   carrying all of it).
2. *Aggregated weights* for linked_trip and tour: the mean of their members'
   final weights (excluding nulls and zeros). The joint levels **sum** instead
   -- see [`Agg`][processing.weighting.core.hierarchy.Agg].

    """Attach existing weights to the data.

    Loads weights from provided files and attaches them to the data.

    For any tables that exist, and do not have weights provided, we can optionally
    derive missing weights from the next logical upstream table.

    For example, if only household weights exist, persons share their household's
    weight and each person's days split that person's weight. If trip (unlinked)
    weights exist but not linked trips or tours, those are the mean of their trips.

    # Weight hierarchy logic

        hh_weight
          └─ person_weight        (carry forward via hh_id)
              └─ person_day_weight        (split: person_weight / n_usable_days)
                  └─ unlinked_trip_weight  (carry forward via person_day_id)
                      ├─ linked_trip_weight   (mean agg via linked_trip_id)
                      │   └─ joint_trip_weight (SUM agg via joint_trip_id)
                      └─ tour_weight          (mean agg via tour_id)
                          └─ joint_tour_weight (SUM agg via joint_tour_id)

    The shape is declared once in
    [`HIERARCHY`][processing.weighting.core.hierarchy.HIERARCHY]; this
    step only supplies the weights it is given and derives the rest from it.

    Supplied weights move household -> person -> day -> trip, each level only
    within the level above it; the rules, the arithmetic and worked examples
    are on the Existing Weights docs page. In short: households scale by one
    factor per household size; persons copy their household, a dropped
    person's share staying inside it; a person's days carry exactly that
    person's weight; a trip is scaled by its day's factor; linked trips and
    tours are the mean of their final trips.

    Checked before the step returns, per profile, raising on failure:

    - the household total equals the supplied total;
    - ``hh_weight x num_persons == sum(person_weight)`` for every household;
    - each person's days sum to that person's weight, when both are supplied;
    - each derived level against the identity it was derived by;
    - no record grew past its ``max_weight_factor``;
    - no dropped record carries weight, and the formatter's own record
      selection keeps every weight.

    The person total is logged against the supplied total rather than held:
    size groups hold it exactly, except where the top group joins sizes. Not
    held, by design: the trip, linked trip and tour totals.

    Args:
        weights: A dict mapping config keys to weight file settings.
            Each entry specifies a weight CSV to load.  Supported config
            keys: ``hh_weight``, ``person_weight``,
            ``person_day_weight``, ``unlinked_trip_weight``,
            ``linked_trip_weight``, ``joint_trip_weight``,
            ``tour_weight``, ``joint_tour_weight``.

            Config options per entry:

            - ``weight_path``: Path to CSV file containing weights (required).
            - ``weight_id_col``: ID column name in the weight file
              (optional, defaults to canonical table ID).
            - ``weight_col``: Weight column name in the weight file
              (optional, defaults to canonical weight column).

        existing: How supplied weights move onto usable records, per
            profile. See ``ExistingWeightsConfig``.
        tables: Any of the canonical tables in the contract; each one present
            gets weights.

    Returns:
        Dict of tables with attached weights.
