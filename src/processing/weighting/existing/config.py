    Most fields use sensible defaults - typically you only need to provide weight_path.
    Override weight_id_col only if your weight file uses different ID column names.
    Override weight_col only if your weight file uses different weight column names.

    Examples:
        Basic usage with defaults:
        >>> ExistingWeightConfig(config_key="hh_weight", weight_path="hh_weights.csv")
        # Uses: weight_id_col="hh_id", weight_col="hh_weight"

        ...     weight_path="person_weights.csv",
        ...     weight_col="final_weight"  # Weight file uses "final_weight" not "person_weight"
