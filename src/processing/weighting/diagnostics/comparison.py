"""Pairwise comparison of weight sets, at every level of the hierarchy.

A *weight set* is one complete assignment of weights across the hierarchy: a
profile this run fitted, or a set that arrived with the survey and is being used
as a reference. Any two of them can be compared at any level where both carry a
column.

# What a comparison can and cannot say

Weights from two methods are **not** expected to agree record by record.
Balancing matches *marginal totals*, and many different weight vectors satisfy
the same margins equally well, so two methods can both be correct and still
disagree on nearly every household. Low correlation is not evidence that either
is wrong, and high correlation is not evidence that either is right. Nothing
here is a validation, and the report says so above the plot rather than in a
footnote.

What the comparison *can* show is how far apart two sets are, whether they
agree on which records are heavy, and whether the gap is even across the range
of weights or widens at one end. The report shows those numbers and leaves the
judgement to the analyst.

# The fit line

Least squares is the wrong fit for two weight sets. It treats one set as known
and the other as noisy, so ln(A) on ln(B) and ln(B) on ln(A) give slopes that
are not reciprocals, and a weak correlation drags both toward zero. On bats_2023
the household fit of our weights on the vendor's gave 0.42, the reverse fit
implied 1.74, and the spreads actually differ by a factor of 0.86. The reduced
major axis is symmetric and does not dilute: its slope is the ratio of the two
spreads, signed by the correlation.
