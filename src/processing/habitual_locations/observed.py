"""Observed locations: places found by clustering the person's stays.

Two kinds of evidence are clustered, each within the buffer:

- Workplaces and schools: stops made for that purpose that lasted long enough.
- Homes: where days the respondent said began or ended at a home began or
  ended.

A cluster within the buffer of a reported location of the same kind *is* that
location, so it is not added. Nothing else is ever clustered: a corner store by
the house or lunch by the office says it is somewhere else.
