"""Habitual locations: find each person's anchors, and say which one a trip end is at.

A *habitual location* is an anchor: a place a person has a standing
relationship with — their home, their workplace, their school — as opposed to
somewhere they merely happened to stop. Two tables come out of here, because
identity and presence have different existence conditions. A habitual location
exists whether or not the person went there during the diary period — a
reported workplace belonging to someone who teleworked all week is still their
workplace — so it cannot live on a table keyed by day::

    habitual_locations      one row per (person, kind, number)
                            who / where / how we know

    habitual_location_days  one row per (location, day) the person was present
                            how long / how many visits / how the day related

For example::

    habitual_locations
      person  type  num  is_primary  source
      1       WORK  1    True        reported
      1       WORK  2    False       observed   <- a Tue/Thu office
      2       HOME  1    True        reported
      2       HOME  2    False       reported   <- a second home

The table is delivered by survey cleaning holding the reported locations —
the survey's home, work and school coordinates, plus any further ones such as
a vendor's second home — built by :func:`reported_habitual_locations` and
taken as given. The ``detect_habitual_locations`` step, after trip linking,
appends the observed ones and writes the day table; it never changes a delivered
row. Tour extraction and everything after only read it.

Observed locations:

- Observed homes: days the respondent said began or ended at home or at their
  other home, placed where that day's travel began or ended. Away from every
  reported home, such a place is another home of theirs.
- Observed workplaces and schools: places the person went for that purpose and
  stayed long enough.

Homes are never inferred from travel alone. A stay at "another residence" may be
a second home or a friend's flat, and only the respondent can say which.

A single buffer (``MatchConfig.buffer_meters``) is the whole spatial
vocabulary. Stops within it of one another are one place; a place within it of a
reported location is that location, so it is not added again; and a trip end
within it of a location is at that location when its purpose agrees with the
location's kind (:func:`matching.match_points`). Only an agreeing purpose
counts: an unknown one matches nothing. Tour extraction asks the same question
through :func:`match_trip_ends`, with the same buffer.

Modules:

- ``detect_habitual_locations``: the pipeline step.
- ``habitual_location_configs``: the rules.
- ``reported``: the delivered table, built from the survey's coordinates.
- ``episodes``: trips as stays.
- ``observed``: clustering, and the observed locations.
- ``numbering``: primacy, numbering and identifiers.
- ``matching``: the one "at a location" test.
- ``location_days``: the per-day table.
